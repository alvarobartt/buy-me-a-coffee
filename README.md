# Buy Me A Coffee! :coffee:

As some of you may already know, I just opened my buymeacoffee site, where any of you can contribute buying the developer a coffee.

At first I was reluctant to open a funding page, but since some people that have contacted me for any open source related issues asking me how could they contribute or if I had any page where they could donate or help me in any way for my hard work, after some time thinking about it I decided that the best site that fitted with me and the content I want to provide you all, was buymeacoffee.

buymeacoffee is a website that contacts developers, designers, artists, etc. with their communities so that people can contribute and help them out so that the content they offer is better since the rewarding system encourages creators to continue doing what they like and helping others.

If you can contribute or you want to, feel free to do it at [__Buy me a coffee! :coffee:__](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/alvarobartt), I will be really thankfull for anything even if it is a coffee or just a kind comment towards my work, because that helps me a lot. Whenever you contribute with a donation, I will read your message and it will be shown in my main site.

### Be careful and donate just if it is within your possibilities, because there is no refund system. And re
you don't need to donate, it is just a free choice for you. Thank you!
